 This class manages GAM's Native + Banner combined header bidding requests using AdLoader and listens to the respective callbacks.
 It also communicates with the OpenWrap SDK, via POBBannerEvent delegate, to inform the GAM banner ad events.
 Native/custom native ad callbacks are provided through specific delegates POBGAMNativeAdDelegate or POBGAMCustomNativeAdDelegate, while banner ad events are provided through POBBannerViewDelegate as usual.
 Note: You must set up banner demand, in addition to native and/or custom native, to include OW banner bids
